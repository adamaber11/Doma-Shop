## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich teal (#008080) to convey trust and sophistication in online shopping.  Avoid cliches such as 'ecommerce must be blue' to remain visually distinctive.
- Background color: Light teal (#E0F8F8), visibly of the same hue as the primary color but heavily desaturated and lightened for a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Mustard (#D4A22D) to highlight essential CTAs and create a warm contrast with the primary teal, drawing attention to key actions.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its modern, machined, objective, and neutral aesthetic, is recommended for a clean and highly readable interface suitable for an e-commerce environment.
- Responsive grid layout adapting to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across all devices.
- Use a consistent style of minimalist icons throughout the website to aid in navigation and highlight key features, enhancing the user experience without clutter.
- Subtle transitions and animations for interactive elements (e.g., adding to cart, product image carousel) to provide visual feedback and create a more engaging user experience.
